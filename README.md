# ⚡ Khamba Tareq (খাম্বা তারেক)

A satirical **Flappy Bird–style arcade game** featuring the infamous *Electric Poles* (খাম্বা).  
Navigate through a never-ending grid of utility poles, collect **Taka (৳)**, and try to keep your **offshore balance** growing.

---

## 🎮 The Story

In a land where electric poles exist but electricity is optional,  
**one man must fly through the infrastructure he helped build.**

Your mission:
- Stay airborne  
- Avoid the poles (even if they have no wires)  
- Collect as much *development budget* (৳) as possible  

Because progress must continue… even without power.

## ✨ Features

- 🐢 **Slow-Motion Physics**  
  Designed for a *relaxed* flight experience. High gravity is just a conspiracy.

- 💰 **Taka Collection System**  
  Grab floating ৳ coins to build your offshore balance.

- 💾 **Persistent Wealth**  
  Your coins are saved in the browser’s `localStorage` — because the budget never resets.

  A direct link to the grand vision (opens an external link on Game Over).

- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
