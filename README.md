⚡ Khamba Tareq (খাম্বা তারেক)
A satirical, Flappy Bird-style arcade game featuring the infamous "Electric Poles" (Khambas). Navigate through a never-ending grid of utility poles, collect "Taka," and try to keep your offshore balance growing!

🎮 The Story
In a land where electric poles exist but electricity is optional, one man must fly through the infrastructure he helped build. Your goal? Stay airborne, avoid the poles (even if they have no wires), and collect as much "development budget" (৳) as possible.

✨ Features
Slow-Motion Physics: Designed for a "relaxed" flight experience. High gravity is just a conspiracy!

Detailed Khambas: Authentic electric pole obstacles complete with cross-arms and porcelain insulators.

Taka Collection System: Grab the ৳ coins floating between poles to build your offshore balance.

Persistent Wealth: Your coins are saved in your browser's localStorage—because the budget never resets.

"His Plan" Button: A direct link to the grand vision (opens an external link on Game Over).

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop (Spacebar) and mobile (Tap).

🛠️ Technical Setup
The game is built with pure "Vanilla" technology—no heavy frameworks, just raw power:

HTML5 Canvas: For high-performance rendering.

JavaScript (ES6): Custom physics engine and collision logic.

CSS3: Flexbox layout and mobile-responsive scaling.

🕹️ Controls
